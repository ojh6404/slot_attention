## slot-attention-pytorch
 This repo is the Pytorch Implementation of paper "Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention". It uses the slot attention module from [here](https://github.com/lucidrains/slot-attention) but augments it with encoder, decoder and train/test scripts.

 The official Tensorflow repository has been released <a href="https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/slot_attention">here</a>. This repo should be a direct translation from the official Tensorflow repo to a PyTorch version.
